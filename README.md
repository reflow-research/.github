# Reflow Research

**Deterministic Financial AI**  
*Verifiable. Auditable. Reproducible.*

We build the execution and verification layer for agentic finance: systems where workflows and strategies run **deterministically**, are **policy-enforced**, and stay **replayable end-to-end** for audits, incident response, and “what-if” simulation.

## What we’re building

### Frostbite — deterministic execution for strategies & agents
- **Deterministic execution:** same inputs + same policy version → same outcome (no hidden state, no race conditions).
- **Policy-enforced integrations:** permissions, approvals, limits, and circuit breakers enforced at decision time.
- **Replay + simulation:** reproduce incidents and test changes safely before shipping.
- **Compute where assets live:** run real decision logic close to liquidity to reduce latency and trust assumptions.

## Why it matters

Modern finance can’t adopt agentic systems at scale without **proof**:
- What happened?
- Why did it happen?
- Could it have happened differently?
- Can an auditor reproduce it?

Reflow Research exists to make these answers **native to the execution layer**.

## Contributing

We welcome collaborators who care about:
- deterministic execution
- verifiable logs / replayability
- secure integrations & guardrails
- systems that hold up under audit

**How to contribute**
1. Open an issue with the problem + desired behavior.
2. Propose a minimal spec or test case.
3. Submit a PR with clear determinism + safety notes.

## Philosophy

**Ship systems you can prove.**  
If it can’t be reproduced, it can’t be trusted.
